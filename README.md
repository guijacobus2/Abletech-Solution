Programming solution for the problem provided by the company Abletech 

The challange was :

For the numbers 1 to 100, print a string for each number as per the following rules: If the number is divisible by 3, print ‘Foo’ If the number is divisible by 5, print ‘Bar’ If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, print ‘FooBar’ If the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, print the number.

I decided to develop this using pure Javascript.
